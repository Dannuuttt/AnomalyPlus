;"The SI-65A Oscillograph is an oscilloscope used in mobile science labs around The Zone. It is used for conducting various measurements and tests, specifically with electronic devices and certain anomalous phenomena. It is rather expensive and would fetch a nice price at a looter camp, however, that would equate to Sakharov losing invaluable lab equipment, making you a kill-on-sight at any mobile lab."
